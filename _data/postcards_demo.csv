He became one of the breed's greatest series, one of the few truly top rank, elite stallions. Though Abu Farwa was bred by the Kellogg Ranch, his career was made by his long-time owner H.H. Reese. As an individual, he was outstanding, but his supreme value lay in his ability as a sire to transmit the type and character of his Crabbet heritage, especially his lovely forehead, overall balance and symmetry as well as his great trotting ability. Abu Farwa founded a veritable dynasty of champions.
