# Biographical / Historical

In 1925, cereal magnate W.K. Kellogg established an Arabian horse breeding program at his winter ranch home in Pomona, California. The Kellogg Ranch became a popular destination for 1920s Hollywood stars and the horses were showcased for the public at Sunday shows.

 

W.K. Kellogg donated the ranch to the state of California in 1932 with the stipulation that the Arabian breeding program and Sunday shows continue. During World War II, the ranch was used by U.S. Army as a remount depot to breed horses for the cavalry.

 

After the war, the ranch was briefly administered by the Department of Agriculture before being turned over to California State Polytechnic College San Luis Obispo for use as their southern branch in 1949. The campus grew rapidly in the post-war period and Cal Poly Pomona was established as a separate school in 1966. Cal Poly has maintained the Arabian horse breeding program and Sunday shows to the present day according to W.K. Kellogg's wishes.
